# NRHP
This project's goal is to create a database from current National Register of Historic Places listings and provide the current listings in a given locality.

# Future Ideas
This project is still a work in progress and I hope to implement these features in the future:

-Ability to automatically fetch nomination pdfs for a specific listing, or for all listings in a given locality
-Map listings of a given locality for user interaction, directions, etc.
-Create a barebones wikipedia page for a given listing
