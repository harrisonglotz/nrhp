# NRHP
These scripts create a database from current National Register of Historic Places listings and provide the current listings in a given locality.

Due to the size of the National Register of Historic Places, the excel spreadsheet download and database creation are in a seperate file. I encourage anyone using this to run the script every week or so to ensure accurate listing data.

# Future Ideas
This project is still a work in progress and I hope to implement these features in the future:

-Ability to automatically fetch nomination pdfs for a specific listing, or for all listings in a given locality

-Map listings of a given locality for user interaction, directions, etc.

-Create a barebones wikipedia page for a given listing

-National Historic Landmark support
