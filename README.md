# NRHP
This project's goal is to be able to make the National Register of Historic Places more searchable for my personal python projects.

# Motivation
While historic preservation is a large and dedicated community, it lacks readily available information about historically significant properties. The hope is to be able to create a full scale application to query against this data.
